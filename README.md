**Title**
Butterfly Specie Classification using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques.

**Abstract**
Automatic identification of butterfly species is an important research in the field of 
lepidopterology. The limited ability of the human eye to distinguish typical textures on butterfly 
species is one of the primary reasons for proposing a system for butterfly identification based on 
pattern recognition. Various species of butterflies have different textures on their wings. Due to 
the diversity of species, there is a significant degree of similarity and it is difficult to distinguish 
butterflies apart. Low accuracy and slow speed recognition are issues with butterfly 
identification and classification. Further, the number of taxonomists and trained technicians 
have decreased over the years. A generalized system for automatic identification and 
classification of butterfly species is proposed for eradicating the constraints of traditional 
approaches of butterfly species classification. The proposed work involves classification of 
butterfly images using traditional approach along as well as deep learning approach. The gray 
level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM and local binary pattern (LBP) is employed as primary tools 
for feature extraction. The features extracted from these techniques are fed as an input to the 
KNN classifier for classification and is accounted for traditional approach. The AlexNet 
classifier is used for the classification of butterfly species as a part of deep learning approach. 
The results obtained from traditional and deep learning techniques are compared and a 
comprehensive feasibility study is carried out successfully. Thus, the proposed work helps in 
the recognition and identification of butterfly species using advanced machine learning 
techniques and provide contribution to the field of entomology in developing a faster, and more 
precise techniques for accurate classification of butterfly species.
